# Mad Libs

The program will run on any madlibs, as long as different blanks are labaled (e.g., animal1, animal2) and each blank is surrounded by <> (e.g., <adjective1>). An example story is attached. If you would like your own, you can simply ask chat gpt "Give me a random mad libs story where every blank is surrounded by <word> where blanks are labeled for clarity."
